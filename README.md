Code-along notebook for _Effective Python_ by Brett Slatkin.  
This repo captures hands-on examples and takeaways from each item in the book â€” distilled, coded, and explained.

## About

This project is my learning companion as I read through _Effective Python_ (2nd Edition).  
Each folder or script represents an "Item" from the book, along with my own notes, experiments, and takeaways.
